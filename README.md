# landing-page
Landing page project for developing CSS and HTML skills.

I completed this project as part of The Odin Project curriculum where we were tasked with designing a landing page using only CSS and HTML. The project was completed by myself with no outside help except from Google. I learned a lot about how HTML and CSS behave and interact and I now feel much more confident in my HTML and CSS skills having applied
what I learned in the curriculum to a practical project (e.g. setting up an HTML doc, using divs and classes to create containers and style specific content, how to remove default styles from HTML, applying styles both inline and with an external CSS sheet, etc.). Most importantly in my opinion, I mastered flexbox to get elements to go exactly where I want them to, which I struggled to do before.

This landing page is just filled with dummy content but I will revisit it in the future to add a theme or a fake business's content. This landing page is not yet optimized for viewing on mobile devices (something that I will
learn about later in the curriculum).
